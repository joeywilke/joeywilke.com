Bio: My full name is Eugene J Wilke III, but please call me Joey. Nothing excites me more than a smart grid and a sharp sans serif. My first creative itchings as a kid were for film photography, and it still informs my drive for composition, intricacy, and wonder in my work. When I’m in nature I’m happiest, so when I’m not designing I garden, camp, and hike with my dog, George.
