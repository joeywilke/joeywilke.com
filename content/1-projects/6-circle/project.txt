CIRCLE OF CONFUSION is the New York and L.A. based management and production entity responsible for representation of the industry's top writing and directing talents as well as many of movie and television's top films and series.

I was tasked with turning designs refined in photoshop into a functional wordpress website that could be easily updated by the client. Designing a custom theme from scratch I took pixel-perfect attention to detail and realized it in code.
