For an initial exploration into making a full usable app, I created Cumulus. A concept tool that, through observing your browsing habits, allows you to see exactly how you interact with your browser and get lost online, compares your browsing to global trends within the app's dataset, and provides the ability capture and export browsing sessions for later use like academic or professional research. 

Through visualizing states of psychological flow while getting lost online, users hopefully get to see that falling into an internet hole isn't just counter-productive, but a valuable form of exploration and play.
