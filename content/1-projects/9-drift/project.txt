Text: 

An excercise in atmosphere, visual conventions of mapping, video editing and flash development, I created this document of a walk around the city on a rainy day. Using a flash micro-site, I tried to capture the sombre nature of walking alone on a gray day. Experience the site [here](http://joeywilke.com/alt/drift/low-res).
