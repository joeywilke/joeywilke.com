When joining the VXDesign team, a fairly new team within the Amazon Prime org, I found a few places where I could use my experience and technical abilities to create tools that saved time and increased the visibility of the team within the larger Prime organization.

I created the billboard tool allow anyone to try typography out on the fly, providing feedback in terms of spacing and total character count which removes the guess work for all parties involved. Give it a try <a href="http://joeywilke.com/alt/gatewayBBTool/">here</a> For example purposes only.)

caption:<h4>Photoshop SmartExport 0.9b</h4><br />To speed up automation within our team, I wrote a photoshop script that:<br /><br />
<ul><li> Grabs the file name of the current PSD</li>
<li>Allows the user to create a complex naming schema based on a prepend + the smart object layer name, as well as define the export format</li>
<li>Opens each smart object selected in the current Photoshop document</li>
<li>Exports a web-safe image into the directory of your choice with the specific name</li></ul>)

This elevated the usefulness of our wiki, and also being aesthetically pleasing our wiki became a reference for other teams at amazon looking to revamp their own wiki documents. )
