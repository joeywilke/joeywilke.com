For the launch of FREE Same-Day Shipping in the US, I produced graphic placements, pages, and print materials to advertise the launch. Working closely with Sarah I created examples of how Eric's illustrations would be used throughout major contact points to fit with the voice of the Amazon Prime brand, and then provided assets and direction to the production team to flesh out advertising materials for worldwide audiences.
