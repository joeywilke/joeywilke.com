When Amazon prepared to launch Free Same-Day Shipping in the US I produced graphic placements, pages, and print materials to advertise the upcoming launch. To ensure adherence to the Prime brand, I worked under Sarah's guidance to transform Eric's illustrations into a set of visual conventions that could be applied across a range of varied deliverables that would be seen by millions of Amazon customers. After creating a cohesive deliverable package, I provided direction to the production team who would localize graphics for targeted marketing in the major US metro areas for launch.
