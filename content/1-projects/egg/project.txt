Working with Charles at ACS, I took a single style frame and fleshed out over 100 graphics in the span of a few short weeks to advertise the launch of the Amazon Electronic Gift Guide. With intimate knowledge of almost every graphic placement used by Amazon, I was able to provide the right size and layout for each graphic the first time, saving time and energy for my team as well as the client. Below is a small sampling of the assets created.
