One of the fastest growing sections within the Electronics vertical, the (link: http://amazon.com/wearabletech text: Amazon Wearable Technology) storefront was in need of an update. A few of the widgets in the back end were outdated, did not allow for flexible updating, and the graphics being edited in a piecemeal fashion by multiple designers on the team often times led to an inconsistent visual appearance. I created a flexible visual system that could not only match the Amazon brand, but the varied brands within the wearable technology market.
